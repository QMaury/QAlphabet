# QAlphabet
QMaury's revised Latin Alphabet with a focus on being more readable and differentiated.

I've been fed up with the standard Latin alphabet recently. Too many letters look similar and too many letters uppercase/lowercase differentiation is just being bigger/smaller. This slightly redesigned alphabet aims to fix that.
